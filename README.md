# TraIT Cell Line Use Case (CLUC) Dataset
domain: cluc.trait-platform.org

## What is CLUC dataset

Cell Line Use Case (CLUC) Dataset is a set of privacy-free high-throughput biomolecular profiling data provided by TraIT. This dataset serves as test data for developing and testing data management systems of translational research without the issues of privacy. The dataset includes results obtained from various high-resolution molecular profiling technology, such as microarrays, next generation sequencing and tandem mass spectrometry for several human cell-lines. Both the raw and processed data have been made available for testing purposes of biomedical research IT platforms.

## Raw CLUC data

The raw data are made public in EGA via this [link](https://ega-archive.org/studies/EGAS00001001476). You need to contact EGA
Helpdesk for access to the data.

Alternatively, you can get a copy of all raw data from [Beehub](https://beehub.nl/TraIT-Datateam/Data/Cell%20Line%20use%20case/). You need
to contact TraIT service desk for the authorisation.

## Processed CLUC data
Processed CLUC data are organized and uploaded into tranSMART v16.1. You can get a copy
of tranSMART-ready data from this [link](https://trng-b2share.eudat.eu/records/21bdc3128e1541da83dc48c51cd39a5f),
current version of tranSMART-ready data is also 16.1

## A tranSMART server to show case the metadata mapping
To showcase the metadata mapping in the paper **Systematically Linking tï¿¼ranSMART, Galaxy and EGA for Reusing Human Translational Research Data** (Chao Zhang, et al.),
we prepare a tranSMART server. You can visit it via [https://transmart.ctmm-trait.nl](https://transmart.ctmm-trait.nl)
or [transmart.thehyve.net](http://transmart.thehyve.net).(Username: cluc_data, password: test_case)

## How to cite the CLUC data?
Currently, we are preparing a data submission manuscript to fully describe and release the CLUC data.

Until this data set will become citable, you can refer to the following paper:
