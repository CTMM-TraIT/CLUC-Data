# TraIT Cell Line Use Case (CLUC) Dataset
domain: cluc.trait-platform.org

## What is CLUC dataset

Cell Line Use Case (CLUC) Dataset is a bunch of privacy-free high-throughput biomolecular profiling data provided by TraIT. This dataset serves as test data for developing and testing data management systems of translational research without the issues of privacy. The dataset includes results obtained from various high-resolution molecular profiling technology, such as microarrays, next generation sequencing and tandem mass spectrometry. Both raw and processed data have been made available for testing purposes of biomedical research IT platforms.

## Raw CLUC data

The raw data are made public in EGA via this [link](https://ega-archive.org/studies/EGAS00001001476). You need to contact EGA
Helpdesk for the access to the data.

Alternatively, you can get the whole copy of raw data from [Beehub](https://beehub.nl/TraIT-Datateam/Data/Cell%20Line%20use%20case/). You need
to contact TraIT service desk for the authorisation.

## Processed CLUC data
Processed CLUC data are organized and uploaded into tranSMART v16.1. You can get a copy
of tranSMART-ready data from this [link](https://trng-b2share.eudat.eu/records/21bdc3128e1541da83dc48c51cd39a5f),
current version of tranSMART-ready data is also 16.1

## A tranSMART server to show case the metadata mapping
To showcase the metadata mapping in the paper **Systematically Linking tï¿¼ranSMART, Galaxy and EGA for Reusing Human Translational Research Data** (Chao Zhang, et al.),
we prepare a tranSMART server. You can visit it via [https://transmart.ctmm-trait.nl](https://transmart.ctmm-trait.nl)
or [transmart.thehyve.net](http://transmart.thehyve.net).(Username: cluc_data, password: test_case)

## Paper on CLUC data
A paper on CLUC data is currently prepared. More information to follow.
